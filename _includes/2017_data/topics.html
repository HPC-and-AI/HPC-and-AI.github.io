                    both the Lecture and Hands-On Exercises in this tutorial. 
                    The tutorial will cover basic and advanced topics of applying
                    the error-bounded lossy compression for large-scale model training
                    in federated learning environments. The tutorial is structured into

                        <h4><strong>Section 1</strong></h4>
                        <p>we provide a comprehensive introduction to errorbounded lossy compression, including its underlying concept, motivation, and representative use cases. We also present an in-depth
overview of large-scale model training within federated learning environments, covering its fundamental principles, parameter aggregation strategies, existing bottlenecks, limitations of current solutions, and open frameworks. Finally, we offer a detailed introduction to differential privacy, discussing its core concept, mechanisms for data protection, and applications in federated learning.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Section 2</strong></h4>
                        <p>we present the motivation for employing errorbounded lossy compression to reduce communication overhead
during large-scale model training in cross-silo federated learning
systems. We further introduce an algorithm designed to estimate an
appropriate error bound, thereby ensuring model accuracy while
applying error-bounded lossy compression to model parameters.
Additionally, we discuss resource utilization in large-scale model
training within cross-silo federated learning environments, including CPUs, GPUs, and networks, and identify potential strategies
for further enhancing system performance. Finally, we provide
experimental results based on widely adopted benchmarks.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Section 3</strong></h4>
                        <p>we present the motivation for employing errorbounded 
                            lossy compression of model parameters to simultaneously
                            achieve communication efficiency and fairness in large-scale model
                            training within cross-silo federated learning environments. 
                            Additionally, we propose an algorithm for estimating an appropriate
                            error bound based on the information entropy of the training data
                            and model performance, thereby ensuring both communication
                            efficiency and fairness. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive
                            theoretical analysis of the aggregation error introduced 
                            by parameter compression. Finally, we present an extensive experimental
                            evaluation using widely used benchmarks.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Section 4</strong></h4>
                        <p>we will present the motivation for introducing
differential privacy (DP) guarantees into the quantization process
and review state-of-the-art DP-quantization approaches. We begin with a general guideline for injecting DP-guaranteed noise
into the quantization process, followed by a taxonomy of existing
DP-quantization methods and an overview of several representative techniques. We then introduce a unified analytical framework
that we propose, which integrates standardized DP proofs and
consistent utility analysis. Finally, we present key insights from our comprehensive reproduction and replication study of existing
DP-quantization methods, and discuss their practical trade-offs,
highlighting how these findings can inform the design of future
DP-quantization mechanisms.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Section 5</strong></h4>
                        <p>we will introduce APPFL, a highly modular opensource framework designed to make privacy-preserving federated
learning both practically deployable and easy to extend. It allows
researchers and practitioners to freely mix and match FL algorithms,
differential privacy mechanisms, communication protocols (MPI
for HPC simulation and gRPC for real cross-institution deployment), models, and datasets in a true plug-and-play fashion. We
will also introduce the core technical contribution about IIADMM,
a new communication-efficient algorithm based on inexact ADMM
that completely eliminates the transmission of dual variables from
clients to server (unlike the earlier ICEADMM), thereby cutting
communication volume roughly in half while matching or exceeding the accuracy of FedAvg and ICEADMM.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Section 6</strong></h4>
                        <p>we introduce FedDES, a super-fast discrete-event
simulator built specifically to predict the real-world runtime of huge
federated learning systems with hundreds of thousands of devices.
Instead of painfully running actual training tasks, FedDES profiles
a small real deployment once, extracts the key costs (training time,
model upload/download, aggregation), and then turns the entire FL
process into a handful of timed events. Using SimGrid’s accurate
network and compute modeling plus a smart priority-queue scheduler, it simulates synchronous (FedAvg), asynchronous (FedAsync),
and semi-asynchronous (FedCompass) strategies under realistic
heterogeneity, stragglers, and network conditions</p>

                        <p>we provide a practical guide on deploying APPFL,
an open framework designed for large-scale model training in federated learning environments. Additionally, we present a case study
demonstrating the process of training large-scale models using this
framework. To further analyze system performance in large-scale
training scenarios, we introduce FedDES, a simulator capable of
modeling collaboration among a large number of nodes during
model training. We detail the deployment process of FedDES and
illustrate how it can be utilized to evaluate system performance.</p>
